### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

The topics discussed in both Merge Mayhem and Weather Report helped me get familiarized with Git and React. Since this was my first time working wit React, I was able to use the labs as an extra source of learning. These helped me get comfortable with things as simple as setting up the components to using react functions in my code. 

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time, I would have learned more about local storage so that I could implement a favorite and watched button for each movies that users can mark as they wish and come back to. I would have also liked to implement a trailer embed for each movie and continue enhancing the look of my website.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

My project demo went pretty well. I was able to slow down and explain the concepts learned areas where I need to improve. One of my peers implemented a search button so that when you click it, the search bar appears. Another one of my peers implemented the movie trailer into their modal which was very cool to see. These two features are ones that I had initially had planned to implement but didnt get the chance to.

### Shout out

Give a shout out to somebody from your cohort that especially helped you during your project. This can be a fellow peer, instructor, TA, mentor, etc.

I would like to give a shoutout to my instructors (Devarsh, Keith, Alex) who went above and beyond to help me succeed. Additionally, I would like to shout out my peers Kailey and Nathan for helping me and guiding me throughout my project!!
